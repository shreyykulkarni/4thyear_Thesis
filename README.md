1. Assembled a three-wheeled robot with an NVIDIA Jetson Nano, motor drivers, and an image sensor.
2. Implemented an off-policy based reinforcement learning algorithm (Q-learning) on the aforementioned robot. 
3. Fabricated a novel Q-learning environment with an action descriptor, reward function, state transition module. 

File Descriptions: 

1. 'Qvirtual.py' ~ Contains the main Q-learning algorithm, implemented with the custom built environment.
2. 'envirtual.py' ~ Contains the main environment with action and space descriptors, reward functions etc,.
3. 'mainvirtual.py' ~ Contains action and state lists, along with possible rewards.
